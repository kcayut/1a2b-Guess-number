# 1a2b-Guess-number
Let's play a game!
This is a very ancient game that never get old. She can help human kind to know more about each other!
So you can tell whether someone is retarded or not.
And this time, the eneme is ... youself! 
Uh..maybe computer

I reperform her in python, perhaps she is not the best one, but shut up! I love her. 

It's time to talk about game rule:
  1. Pick 4 different number between 0~9.
      for example : 1234
  2. Carefully rearrange them in a specific order.
      for example : 2341
  3. Make otehrs gauss your number and the order,
      if the NUMBER and the POSITION both correct, it denote as A.
      if the NUMBER correct, but the POSITION wrong, it denote as B.
      if neither the NUMBER and the POSITION wrong, it denote as C.
      for example, someone gauss 4315, 
      comparer to the answer '2341',
      '4' number correct, position wrong, 1B.
      '3' number correct, position correct, 1A.
      '1' number correct, position wrong, 1B.
      '5' number wrong, position wrong, 1C.
      So sum up the result it get 1A2B1C.
You should use those ABC hint to find the final answer.

And this program provide 2 mode, 
you can guass the number produced by computer or
you design an number to make computer gauss.
But for the computer gauss part, I only have randam gauss so far, maybe more method well come up sometime. 

BTW I don't know why my "README" format is like a mess, so forgive me, fix oneday.
