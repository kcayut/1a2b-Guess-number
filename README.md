Let's play a game!
This is a very ancient game that never get old. She can help human kind to know more about each other!
So you can tell whether someone is retarded or not.
And this time, the eneme is ... youself! 
Uh..maybe computer

I reperform her in python, perhaps she not be the best one, but shut up! I love her. 

It's time to talk about game rule:
  1. Pick 4 different number between 0~9 \n
        for example : 1234
  2. Carefully rearrange them in a specific order.
        for example : 2341
  3. Make otehrs gauss your number and the order,
      if the NUMBER and the POSITION both correct, it denote as A,
      if the NUMBER correct, but the POSITION wrong, it denote as B,
      if neither the NUMBER and the POSITION wrong, it denote as C.
      for example, someone gauss 4315
